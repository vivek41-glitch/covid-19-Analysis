COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Project Overview

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze global COVID-19 data and uncover meaningful insights about the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across different countries and time periods.

The dashboard focuses on data-driven insights, comparison across regions, and trend analysis to better understand how COVID-19 evolved globally.

Dataset

Dataset Name: Global COVID-19 Statistics Dataset

Includes:

Confirmed cases

Deaths

Recoveries

Active cases

Country / Region-wise data

Date-wise records

Dataset is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes.

Data Preparation & Modeling

Cleaned missing and inconsistent values using Power Query

Standardized country and region names

Created calculated columns for:

Mortality Rate

Recovery Rate

Built DAX measures for key KPIs

Designed a star-schema based data model for performance

Key Insights

The United States recorded the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally.

Mortality rates were significantly higher during early phases of the pandemic.

Recovery rates improved noticeably in later periods.

Europe and North America experienced multiple infection waves.

Some regions showed high case counts but comparatively lower mortality rates.

Dashboard Features

Total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries (KPIs)

Country-wise and region-wise comparisons

Time-based trend analysis

Mortality and recovery rate analysis

Interactive slicers and filters for deep exploration
