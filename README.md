##  Data Preparation & Modeling

- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values using **Power Query**
- Standardized country and region names
- Created calculated columns for:
  - Mortality Rate  
  - Recovery Rate  
- Designed a **star-schema data model** for better performance and scalability

##  Key Insights

- The United States recorded the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally
- Mortality rates were significantly higher during the early phases of the pandemic
- Recovery rates improved noticeably in later periods
- Europe and North America experienced multiple infection waves
- Some regions reported high case counts but comparatively lower mortality rates
